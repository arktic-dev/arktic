In the context of a computer program, reactivity is the process of receiving
external stimuli and propagating events.
This is a rather broad definition that covers a wide variety of topics.
The term is usually reserved for systems that respond in turns to sensors,
schedules, and above all, problems that exist between the chair and keyboard.
