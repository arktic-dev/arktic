To add a demo client:

1. Make sure that the client to be added is the only new client folder in the data directory. Each
   client found when running "demo_input" will be made a "is_demo" client.

2. With the client in the data directory, run "dm demo_input"
3. Done.

To add a demo user:

1. A bit messy at the moment, but just run "dm createsuperuser" as normal.
2. "dm shell"
3. "from apps.users.models import User"
4. "user = User.objects.get(email='<email you just created>')"
5. "user.is_demo = True"
6. "user.save()"
7. Done. Sorry. Needs a better way.

Delete user and client to start process again.
